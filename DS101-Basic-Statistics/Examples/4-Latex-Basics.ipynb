What adjusts how strong the relationship is and what the direction of the relationship is between the inputs and outputs are called __coefficients__. The first coefficient without an input is called the intercept, and it adjusts what the model predicts when all your inputs are 0. There exists a method to calulate the optimal coefficients, given which inputs we want to use to predict the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the coefficients, if we plug in values for the inputs, the linear regression will give us an __estimate__ for what the output should be. These outputs won't always be perfect unless our data ends up in a straight line, our model will not precisely hit all of our data points. One of the reasons for this is the $\\epsilon$ (named epsilon) term. $\\epsilon$ represents error that comes from the sources out of our control, causing the data to deviate slightly from their true position. Our error metrics will be able to judge the differences between prediction and actual values, but we cannot know how much the error has contributed to the discrepancy. While we cannot ever complety elimante $\\epsilon$, it is useful to retain a term for it in a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing model predictions against reality\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our model will produce an output given any input or set of inputs, we can check these estimated outputs against the actual values that we tried to rpedict. We call the difference between the actual value and the mode's estimate a __residual__. We can caluclate the residual for every point in our data set, and each of these residuals will be of use in assessment. These residuals play a signficant role in judging the usefulness of our model selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our collection of residuals are small, it implies that our model that produced themd oes a good job at predicting our output of interest. Conversely, if these rediuals are genearly large, it implies that model is a poor estimator. We technically can inpsect all of the residuals to justge the model's accuracy, but unsurprisignly, this doesn't scale if we have thousands or millions of data pointss. Thus statusicians have developed summary measurements that take our collection of residuals and condense them into a single value that represent the predictive ability of our model. There are many of these summary statisitcs, each with their own advantages and pitfalls. For each, we'll discuss what each statistic represents, theire intuition and typical use case.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "The __mean absolute error__ (MAE) is the simplest regression error metric to understand. We'll calulate the residual for every data point, taking only the absolute value of each so that negative and positive residuals do not cancle out. We then take the average of all these residuals. Effectively, MAE describes the typical magnitude of the residuals. Remember the __mean__ is a descriptive statistic that looks at the aveage value of a data set. Most people understand it as the average. The mean is calculated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the mean:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum y}{N}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\sum y$ Take all the values and add them up\n",
    "- divide by the total number of observations you have\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the mean, the \"middle\" of the data set refers to this typical value. The mean respresents a typical observation in our data set. If we were to pick one of our observations at random, then we're likely to get a value that's close to the mean. The calculation of the mean is a simple task in Python and Pandas. We can get our normal values for an operational profile/phase in a column in the dataframe then run ```df.mean()```\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal equation for MAE is:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "MAE = \\frac{1}{n}{\\sum}| y - \\hat{y} |\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- Divide by the total number of data points $\\frac{1}{n}$\n",
    "- Actual output value $y$\n",
    "- Predicted output value $\\hat{y}$\n",
    "- Sum of the absolute value of the residual ${\\sum}|y - \\hat{y}|$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAE is also the most intuitive of the metrics since weâ€™re just looking at the absolute difference between the data and the modelâ€™s predictions. Because we use the absolute value of the residual, the MAE does not indicate underperformance or overperformance of the model (whether or not the model under or overshoots actual data). Each residual contributes proportionally to the total amount of error, meaning that larger errors will contribute linearly to the overall error. Like weâ€™ve said above, a small MAE suggests the model is great at prediction, while a large MAE suggests that your model may have trouble in certain areas. A MAE of 0 means that your model is a perfect predictor of the outputs (but this will almost never happen).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the MAE is easily interpretable, using the absolute value of the residual often is not as desirable as squaring this difference. Depending on how you want your model to treat outliers, or extreme values, in your data, you may want to bring more attention to these outliers or downplay them. The issue of outliers can play a major role in which error metric you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mean square error\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean square error (MSE is just like MAE, but squares the difference before summing them all instead of using the absolute value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formal equation for MAE is:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "MSE = \\frac{1}{n}{\\sum}( y - \\hat{y} )^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- The square of the difference between actual and predicted $( y - \\hat{y} )^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are squaring the difference, the MSE will almost always be bigger than MAE. For this reason, we cannot directly compare the MAE to the MSE. We can only compare our model's error metrics to those of a competing model. The effect of the square term in the MSE equation is most apparent with the presence of outliers in our data. While each residual in MAE contributes proportionally to the toal error, the error grows quadratically in MSE. This ultimately means that outliers in our data will contribute to much higher total error in the MSE than they would the MAE. Similarly, our model will be penalized more for making predictions that differ greatly from the corresponding actual value. This is to say that large differences between actual and predicted are punished more in MSE than in MAE. The following picture graphically demonstrates what an individual residual in the MSE might look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers will produce exponentially larger differences, and it is our job to judge how we should approach them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem of outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers in our data are a constant source of discussion for data scientists that try to create models. Do we include the outliers in our model creation or do we ignore them? The answer to this question is dependent on the field of study, the data set on hand. We would want to use the MSE to ensure that the model takes these outliers into account more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MSE and RMSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Another error metric we have discussed in the ConOps is the root mean squared error (RMSE). As the name suggests, it is the square root of the MSE. Because the MSE is squared, its units do not match that of the original output. Researchers will often use RMSE to convert the error metric back into similar units, making interpretation easier. Since the MSE and RMSE both square the residual, they are similarly affected by outliers. The RMSE is analogous to the standard deviation (MSE to variance) and is a measure of how large your residuals are spread out. Both MAE and MSE can range from 0 to positive infinity, so as both of these measures get higher, it becomes harder to interpret how well your model is performing. Another way we can summarize our collection of residuals is by using percentages so that each prediction is scaled against the value itâ€™s supposed to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Root mean squared error (RMSE)\n",
    "RMSE is a quadratic scoring rule that also measures the average magnitude of the error. Itâ€™s the square root of the average squared differences between prediction and actual observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}{\\Big(\\frac{d_i -f_i}{\\sigma_i}\\Big)^2}}$\n",
    " \n",
    "## Calculate MSE against our Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Like MAE, we'll calculate the MSE for our Model. With MSE, we would expect it to be a much larger error than MAE due to the influence of outliers. We find that this is the case: the MSE is an order of magnitude higher than MAE. The corresponding RMSE would be a bit higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "The __mean absolute percentage error__ (MAPE) is the percentage equivalent of MAE. The equation looks just like that of MAE, but with adjustments to convert everything into percentages.\n",
    "\n",
